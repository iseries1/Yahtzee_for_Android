# Yahtzee_for_Android
Yahtzee program for Android Tablet Computer

If your first starting out coding and need a challanging program to code then maybe Yahtzee will do the trick.

You need to code some logic that can determine if you have 3 of kind, 4 of a kind, small straight, large straight...

These all take a little thought into determining if you have one of them.

Most of the logic is in the Yahtzee class so don't look in there if you don't want the answers.

This uses the Animation class to make the dice roll on the screen with each throw of the dice....
